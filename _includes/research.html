      <h3>Theme 1 — Molecular Mechanisms of Electrotaxis by Galvanin</h3>
      <p>We aim to uncover how the recently identified electric field sensor, Galvanin, detects and transduces bioelectric cues into directed cell migration. Using live-cell imaging and synthetic biosensors, we will dissect the molecular pathways linking Galvanin’s localization and dynamics to cytoskeletal remodeling, steering cell movement at the single-cell level.</p>

      <h3>Theme 2 — Engineering Cellular Guidance</h3>
      <p>We are developing genetic and synthetic biology tools to precisely control cell migration in complex environments. By engineering Galvanin-based constructs and other bioelectric sensing modules, we aim to direct immune cell movement for applications in immunotherapy, wound healing, and regenerative medicine.</p>

      <h3>Theme 3 — Physiological Roles of Electrical Cues Across Biology</h3>
      <p>Electrical signals are present in diverse physiological contexts, from wound sites to developing tissues to tumor microenvironments. We will probe how different cell types and tissues interpret these cues, identify context-specific sensing mechanisms, and define the broader role of bioelectricity in health and disease.</p>
