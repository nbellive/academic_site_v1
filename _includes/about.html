        We study how cells sense and respond to physical and bioelectrical cues — signals as important as chemical messages but far less understood. Our goal is to uncover the molecular mechanisms that enable cells to detect these <strong>physiochemical signals</strong> and use this knowledge to engineer cell behavior for therapeutic benefit. We pursue this work in the highly interdisciplinary environment of the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/biofrontiers"><strong>BioFrontiers Institute</strong></a> and as part of the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.colorado.edu/biochemistry/home"><strong>Department of Biochemistry</strong></a> at CU&nbsp;Boulder.</p>

        Our current focus is on <strong>bioelectric guidance</strong>—how cells navigate in response to natural electric fields, such as those that arise during wound healing. We recently identified <strong>Galvanin</strong>, a novel electric field sensor in immune cells, revealing a new way that rapidly moving cells integrate electrical cues into migration and signaling.</p>

          <p>We are combining live-cell imaging, synthetic biology, biophysics, and functional genomics to:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Identify and characterize the molecular players in bioelectric sensing and migration.</li>
            <li>Develop tools to precisely control cell movement in complex environments, with applications in immunotherapy and regenerative medicine.</li>
            <li>Probe the physical organization and electrochemical properties of the cell membrane to understand how it shapes protein function and cell behavior.</li>
          </ol>

        By combining mechanistic discovery with tool development, we aim to build a deeper understanding of the physical biology of cells — and use that insight to design new strategies for human health.
